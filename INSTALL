On a brand new installation of Ubuntu 13.10 Saucy Salamander it took 2 packages
to get the multitoner working:

python-numpy
python-scipy

$ sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy
$ ./gtk_multitoner.py

However, multitoner has many dependencies. This is a try to get them all together.
If you managed to get multitoner in a working mood on your system it would be great
if you'd share your knowledge here.


DEPENDENCIES:
============

Python 2.7.x

libgtk-3-0: GTK+ graphical user interface library. I have: 3.6.4
libcairo2: The Cairo 2D vector graphics library. Here: 1.12.14
libgs9: GPL Ghostscript 9.07 (2013-02-14) NOTE: the python-ghostscript
    bindings are included in the source. The public package is not as up-to-date.

python-imaging: The Python Imaging Library, here the Pillow fork 1.1.7
python-gi: Python 2.x bindings for gobject-introspection libraries
python-cairo: NOTE: python-gi-cairo won't do it. get: http://cairographics.org/pycairo/
python-numpy: Numerical Python, here: 1.1.7.1
python-scipy: scientific tools for Python, here 0.11.0
