Create “Multitone” (Monotone, Duotone,  Tritone, Quadtone, …) EPS-files for printing.

Another short description of what the Multitoner does can be found in
[this blogentry](http://graphicore.de/en/archive/2013-06-13_it-is-a-multitoner)


please see INSTALL for info on how to get this thing started.

When everything is fine $ ./gtk_multitoner.py should launch the main window of the application.


Please report to what you experienced with the Multitoner. I'm very curious.
